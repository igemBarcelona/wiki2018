    <p class="fig-caption">Figure X | Growth assay of induced and not induced fadD in enriched medium. Bacteria was grown for 16 hours in enriched medium with a concentration of 0,4mM Palmitic Acid. All bacteria was top10 (DH5-alpha strain). To induce fadD expression a concentration of 60ng/ml of ATc was added. Error bars represent the Standard Deviation of the Mean (SEM). </p>
