        <p class="page-title">Education and Public Engagement</p>
        <p>Science communication is increasingly recognised as a duty for scientists. Thus, apart from the scientific
          innovation of our project, we have also set focus in the social outreach of it. We have taken this matter
          very seriously, as we think that disseminating scientific knowledge can be almost as important as the
          research itself.</p>

        <p class="subapart1">Exploring new educational strategies</p>
        <p>First, we believe it is highly important that the general public understands basic scientific principles.
          This understanding can help the society to have a critical opinion and thus help them to make informed
          decisions, which can influence not only the science research itself and its funding but also the life quality
          of the people. In this context we have held talks in several schools and explored more engaging and
          interactive means of teaching lifesciences to young students through different workshops about skin
          microbiota and nucleic acid extraction. This workshops took place in events such as YOMO or Recerkids.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, we have participated in Hands on Science, an international conference focused on teachers that
          aims to debate on the active learning of the sciences from various perspectives. In this context, we have
          established guidelines and encouraged school science teachers to use practical experiments with basic
          material as pedagogical tools to consolidate and integrate the theoretical knowledge that students receive in
          class [1].</p>

        <p class="subapart1">Promoting science in youth</p>
        <p>In addition, we strongly believe in the possibility of using this educational approach to increase interest
          in science. We have performed several motivational talks at Biojunior to young students that are about to
          decide which bachelor degree to study or that need advise for the High School Research project which is
          implemented in Catalan school. In this way, we could achieve one of our priorities, which is inspiring and
          promoting scientific culture in young students to increase their scientific vocation. We believe that this
          talks might trigger the interest in science of students and inspire them to follow a scientific career.</p>

        <p class="subapart1">Establishing a public dialogue</p>
        <p>Finally, we believe that for a more responsible research, an open and collaborative way of doing science
          must be established. In this way, there must be a two-way process involving both the scientific community and
          the general public. We have worked together to promote a public dialogue about synthetic biology in public
          events such as Pint of science or Science Week. More specifically, we have also focused on raising awareness
          of cancer and metastasis development and how synthetic biology can prove itself useful to prevent metastasis
          among other health conditions. Finally, we have also set focus in raising awareness of the iGEM community
          amongst our socio-economic region.</p>

        <p class="subapart2">Youth Mobile Festival 2018 (YOMO)</p>
        <p>The youth mobile is a parallel congress to the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, oriented to kids from 8
          to 18 years old. There we performed strawberry DNA extraction workshop with basic equipment and explained
          them what is the DNA, its functions and applicabilities in research. We also set focus on the microbiota,
          explaining them some facts about the bacterial-human interactions as well as the implication of the
          microbiota in our skin.</p>

        <p class="subapart2">Schools and High Schools</p>
        <p>We went to different high schools in our region in order to explain our project and introduce iGEM and
          synthetic biology to teenagers from 15 to 17 years old. Two high schools of our region were visited:
          “Col·legi Sant Miquel dels Sants” and “Escola Vedruna”, Barcelona.</p>

        <p class="subapart2">Biojunior 2018</p>
        <p>Biojunior is a congress that takes place in a research center in Barcelona, the PRBB (Barcelona Biomedical
          Research Park). In this congress several researchers present their work to highschool students. The event was
          not only focused on the research of the presenting scientist but also on his or her career. There, we gave a
          motivational speech and explained our project and how the university environment can provide them the
          opportunity to investigate by initiatives like iGEM.

        <p class="subapart2">Science week</p>
        <p>During an entire week the Barcelona city hall promotes different activities to promote science. We
          participated in this event by teaching kids and adults how to extract DNA from strawberries and bananas with
          basic products.

        <p class="subapart2">Second Catalan Biology Society Congress</p>
        <p>We assisted to the II Biology Congress organized by the Catalan Society of Biology. There we had the
          opportunity to explain and discuss with the scientific community our project an ideas. This led us to a
          two-way dialogue in which we could improve and integrate this knowledge to our project but also introduce the
          iGEM community to the Catalan and Spanish research community.

        <p class="subapart2">Pint of Science</p>
        <p>In an attempt to reach the general public, we participated in Pint of science. This event consists of an
          informal activity in which short talks are performed by scientists in a club. In this way, with a fresh beer,
          people could understand what synthetic biology is and how we can use it to prevent metastasis.

        <p>Hands of Science is an international conference focused on teachers that aims to debate on the active
          learning of the sciences from various perspectives. There, we had the opportunity to expose the educational
          tools we had developed in the framework of our project to the teaching community, encouraging teachers to
          implement more engaging an interactive ways to teach science.

        <p class="subapart2">Recerkids</p>
        <p>Recerkids is an educational program organized by the General Directorate for Research of the Generalitat de
          Catalunya and Eduxarxa with the aim of bringing scientific research closer to students. There we performed
          several workshops, in which the students extracted their own DNA and saw agarose gels working.
