        <p>We believe that bidirectional interaction between society and scientists is crucial for the development of a
          successful project. In this way, our team has strongly considered expert advice as well as general public
          opinion, which had directly influenced the direction of our project. </p>


        <p>In this part, we have explored the existing market and alternative therapies, enriching our knowledge with
          advices both from clinical and research areas. We integrated the information given adapting the design of our
          future probiotic and made it suitable for the actual sanitary system. Even though in this project we are only
          presenting a proof of concept, we wanted to address all the possible issues when developing a probiotic that
          is therapy ready and respond to current society needs.</p>

        <p class="subapart1">Exploring existing therapies</p>
        <p>We first discussed our project with Salvador Aznar-Benitah as he has explored the implications of palmitic
          acid in metastasis development. Recently, his team found that overexpression of CD36 allows cells to take up
          lipids from their environment, positively correlating with the metastatic potential. In fact, the association
          of high CD36 expression has been associated with poor prognostic in bladder, lung, and breast cancer among
          others [1]. </p>

        <p>Benitah’s lab is currently working with CD36 antibodies for therapeutic purposes. Antibodies that block
          CD36 and therefore its interaction with fatty acids, decrease the ability of cancer cells to metastasize [2].
          In preclinical studies with mice, they observed that the administration of CD36-blocking antibodies reduced
          the
          number of metastatic tumors and their sizes by 80%. Its administration had also effects even in cases were
          metastasis had already been established, with a total removal of the metastases in 20% of the animals [2].
        </p>


        <div class="HP-display">
          <div>
            <p>Even though it is a highly promising strategy, he estimates it would take at least another four years to
              finish the needed clinical trials. Besides, considering the high cost of antibody-based therapies and the
              infrastructures necessary to administer them, our team thought about possible alternatives. In this way,
              we
              propose a low-cost and accessible approach within everyone’s reach based on synthetic biology. </p>

          necessary to administer them, we propose a low-cost and universally accessible approach” </p>

        <p class="subapart1">Solving dietetic needs </p>
        <p>The relationship between long chain fatty acid (LCFA) intake and disease has been well described. It has
          been proved that a LCFA rich diet can increase the chances of developing a wide range of metabolic diseases
          such as diabetes or obesity [3] and cancer [4]. Interestingly and considering the recent evidences already
          mentioned, it has been described that increasing PA consumption might increase the probabilities of
          developing metastasis.</p>

        <p>Dietary restriction may seem the best approach to this issue. However, as several professionals from the
          Catalan School of nutritionism (CoDiNuCat: www.codinucat.cat) pointed out, PA-restriction from diet is not
          easy. In fact, LCFA are one of the main components of our food intake. In Western diets dietary lipids
          account for 42% of total ingested calories which makes it infeasible to follow a PA-restricted diet [5].
          Information given from Dolors Borau confirmed the lack of an standardized and suitable low LCFA diet for
          cancer patients and brought up the lack of a proper follow-up when applying this diets. She believes that
          this is attributed to i) the difficulty to eliminate dietary fats, which are widely used in the elaboration
          of multiple products offered by the food industry and ii) the low adherence that cancer patients might have
          in such strict diets.</p>

        <div class="HP-display">
          <div>
            <p>Furthermore, as many experts have noted, even though PA is physiologically essential for obtaining
              energy, neuronal activity or respiration our body can synthesized it de novo. Therefore, there shouldn’t
              be any problem in restricting the overload of PA in the diet.</p>

            <p>Considering this, our project sheds light on the need of an alternative approach to this absence in
              cancer patients dietary requirements. Our idea is to target the availability of LCFA directly in the gut
              with a probiotic that could absorb this harmfuls acids in an efficient way. </p>

            diets either for private or public institutions. CoDiNuCat refers to the school of Dietist and nutritionist

        </div>
        <p class="centered-cite">“Up to date, no standardized and suitable low LCFA diet for cancer patients exists.
          Low-fat and hypocaloric diets exist but normally lack a proper professional follow-up”</p>

        <p class="subapart1">Making our probiotic ready for therapeutics</p>
        <p>In the course of our project, we tried to have a system as ready to work in its real environment as
          possible. In this context, Bernhard Paetzold suggested us to explore and analyse the environment in which our
          genetically modified bacteria would work. In fact, in the intestine oxygen concentrations are very low, close
          to anoxia. For this reason, in order to work properly, our product would need to work under anaerobic
          conditions. However, LCFA are degraded via the beta-oxidation pathway, an aerobic pathway for excellence. In
          order to tackle this problem, we used flux balance analysis (FBA) to mathematically analyze the flow of
          metabolites through a metabolic network and predict the cellular growth rate under different environmental
          conditions or genetic perturbations. This would allow us to to find new strategies to engineer <i>E. coli</i>
          for achieving a bacterial system capable of efficiently uptaking LCFA in human gut-like conditions <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:UPF_CRG_Barcelona/Simulation">(see

        <div class="HP-display">
          <div>
            <p>When considering administration it’s also important to be aware of the location of fatty acid absorption
              inside the gut. This absorption occurs mainly in the jejunum but also in the ilium (5%) [8]. Knowing
              this, our probiotic design will need to consider degradable layers to ensure maximal concentration and
              efficiency of our probiotic in the jejunum. </p>

        <p class="centered-cite">“Considering the environment in which our probiotic would have to work lead us to
          explore through flux balance analysis the cellular growth under different environment and genetic

        <p class="subapart1">Safety concerns</p>
        <p>The increasing use of engineered organisms exposes a growing risk of spreading hazardous biological entities
          into the environment. This leads to a concern in the society, as the general public has pointed out during
          many of the public engagement activities we have developed (<a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:UPF_CRG_Barcelona/Public_Engagement">see
            more go to Education and Public
            engagement</a>). Therefore, we decided to include key safeguard requirements in our project to prevent the
          release and proliferation of GMOs in natural ecosystems. In this way, extremely robust biocontainment systems
          must be established in engineered organisms, especially those within a therapeutic context [9].</p>
        <p>After having read and consult with experts in synthetic biology we considered the genomic integration of our
          design using <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:UPF_CRG_Barcelona/Integration">Multiplex Automated Genome
            Engineering (MAGE)</a> [10]. This would help us to have stable and robust
          expression of our system, consequently preventing horizontal gene transfer and reducing the biosafety
          concerns that could arise from plasmid exchange [11].</p>
        <div class="HP-display">
          <div>
            <p>We also explored additional mechanisms that could be developed to further enhance biosafety. In this
              way, we posed and discussed within a theoretical framework the possibility of developing a biocontainment
              system through different KO. FabA and FabB were proposed as potential targets for developing
              termosensible strains. These genes are responsible for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs)
              essential for maintaining cell membrane fluidity [12]. In this way, if the UFAs synthesis is impaired,
              bacteria are not able to hold temperature-dependent changes due to instabilities in the membrane.
              Consequently, KO of either gene leads to UFA auxotrophy [13], which has also been described as a method
              for biocontainment. </p>
          </div>
          <p class="talked-to">Integrating public opinion in our project was of high importance. Thus, we developed and
            participated in many events such as Pint of Science, Week of Science or
            Youth Mobile Festival explaining our project.

        </div>
        <p class="centered-cite">“Genomic integration represents a robust biocontainment system, as it prevents
          horizontal gene transfer”</p>

        <p class="subapart1">Integrating our product in a clinical framework
        </p>
        <p>In order to obtain a product suitable for the existing market and sanitary system we developed a theoretical
          framework in which all the target public needs were included. In this way, information regarding cancer
          patients and cancer therapy was collected and integrated in our probiotic design. </p>
        <p>Maria del Carmen Domínguez Ferreiro and Ana Marina Tarrazo Antelo pointed out that a system to prevent
          metastasis should be used already from the moment in which an infiltrating neoplasm is diagnosed, of any
          degree of invasion. However, it would even be from more benefit to those patients in which lymph node
          involvement had been observed. Thus, our target population will consist on stage 3 and 4 cancer patients, as
          these two groups are the ones with a higher risk to develop metastasis [6]. </p>
        <p>Cancer patients in the mentioned stages usually receive chemotherapy by cycles, which means there is rest
          periods between chemotherapy treatments. Our probiotic would be ingested by the patient in these rest
          periods, as the probability of developing metastasis is higher. Thus, in the lack of treatment, survival
          probability of metastatic cells in blood increases [7]. Secondly, it’s important to consider that the
          chemotherapy damages the microbiome.This could also affect our probiotic, and could therefore produce
          unbalances in the gut ecosystem (dysbiosis) [7].</p>
        <div class="HP-display">
          <div>
            <p>Regarding administration, it’s important to consider that cancer patients suffer a lot of digestive
              problems. Therefore, we consider that the best way to deliver our probiotic could be as a pill or a
              liquid solution.</p>

            <p>We have also contacted Juan M. Vázquez Lago, to see how our probiotic is in concordance with ethic
              criteria in actual medicine. As Juan explained “considering the different factors that involve the
              project, our modified probiotic would not be an ethical problem”.</p>

          <p class="subapart1">Exploring other therapeutic approaches</p>
          <p>During the development of our product, we discussed other applications and its ethical considerations.
            LCFA are involved in many pathologies, among them some of the most common in developed countries. Thus,
            when trying to develop a system which absorbs LCFA efficiently, some questions about its applicability in
            other diseases arose.</p>
          <p class="subapart2">Cardiovascular disease:</p>
          <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the Western world. It contains a broad
            range of pathologies with varied etiologies. LCFA have been described to contribute to the pathogenesis of
            CVD in many different ways: (1) increase of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a strong risk factor
            for CVD (2) atherosclerosis through accumulation of lipids (both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) and
            cholesterol in the subendothelial space (3) increase in insulin resistance due to impaired insulin
            secretion, resulting in hyperinsulinemia and higher glucose levels in blood (4) increase in proinflammatory
            molecules, such as endotoxines and cytokines [14]. </p>
          <div class="HP-display">
            <div>
              <p>We discussed with cardiovascular research professionals the possibilities of developing our product
                for
                cardiovascular approaches. They pointed out the controversial on recent studies about the relationship
                between CVD prevention and dietary fats. Indeed, some recent meta-analyses of observational studies
                have
                shown no association between SFA and CVD risk [15]. However, it must be noted that an important feature
                still to be considered is the foods and/or nutrient replacements which are associated with diets low in
                SFA. Usually, these are coupled with higher intake of poliunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which have
                been also described as harmful for the cardiovascular system [16].
                In this way, we propose an improved alternative, as our probiotic would provide a LCFA-restricted diet
                without the increment of other dietary fats. </p>

          </div>
          <p class="subapart2">Diabetes:</p>
          <p>We also explored its applications in diabetes, as it is one of the most common pathologies in developed
            countries. In the setting of diabetes, a myocardial use of free fatty acids (FFAs) as fuel at the expense
            of glucose occurs due to peripheral insulin resistance and the inability of insulin to suppress lipolysis.
            As a result, an increased energy cost coupled with lipotoxicity and oxidative stress leads to a decrease in
            cardiac efficiency [17].</p>
          <p>Conversely, ketones are the most energetically efficient fuel for the myocardium. Under conditions of
            mild, persistent hyperketonemia, a shift in fuel metabolism towards a more energy efficient fuel (such as
            ketone bodies) has been hypothesised to be helpful. This shift improves oxygen consumption at the
            mitochondrial level, which could improve myocardial work efficiency, enhance myocardial energetics, reduce
            oxidative stress, improve cardiac systolic function, and ameliorate heart failure [18].</p>
          <div class="HP-display">
            <div>
              <p>In this way and taking into account all the given information, we hypothesized that if our product
                efficiently diminished this FFAs source could potentially bring to a beneficial metabolic switch
                avoiding this decrease in the cardiovascular function. However, as Oriol Iborra and Egea pointed out
                “in order to successfully work, our product would need to be coupled to an increase in the
                hiperketonemia, a more efficient energy mean”. </p>

          <p class="subapart2">Obesity</p>
          <p>Current scientific evidence indicates that dietary fat plays a role in weight loss. Meta-analyses of
            intervention trials find that fat-reduced diets cause a 3-4 kg larger weight loss than normal-fat diets
            [19]. However, in some cases dietary fat restrictions can be an issue. Thus, our product could be
            approached from a merely dietetic point of view. If it would be the case, our probiotic could be
            administered in situations in which LCFA-restricted diets had low adherency and the patient’s health was
            strongly impaired. This point raised a lot of ethical considerations, as illicit use of the probiotic for
            not therapeutic purposes could happen. </p>
          <p class="subapart2">Chronic intestinal inflammation pathologies</p>
          <p>Lipids, beyond their energetic role have also been considered important components of cellular signal
            transduction pathways. Their roles in modulating host inflammatory responses are of clinical interest as
            agents of both promotion and resolution [20]. In this way, dietary long chain fatty acids are also
            implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
            or Crohn’s disease. </p>
          <p>The conversion of dietary lipids to proinflammatory molecules is well defined. Higher intake of long chain
            fatty acids such as PA, has been proposed to increase the amount of eicosanoids in the intestine, leading
            to a growing proportion of potentially inflammatory molecules and thus to an increase the risk of
            developing IBD [21]. Doctors and experts in the field believe that the contribution of SFAs is minor
            compared to one of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which can be metabolized into the
            proinflammatory prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. In this way, our product could serve as an
            efficient potential therapy for this type of pathologies only when coupled to a decrease of PUFAs. Thus,
            further selectivity issues of our system should be explored. </p>
          <p class="centered-cite">“Decrease of long chain dietary fats could diminish the amount of potentially
            inflammatory molecules in the intestine and thus the risk of developing intestinal inflammation
            pathologies”</p>
          <p class="subapart1">Product development:</p>
          <p>In order to properly develop our product, we need to make it suitable for the current sanitary system and
            ready to be introduced to the market. Thus, we explored the requirements and the needs that our probiotic
            would need to comply to reach that milestone.</p>

          <p>Carlota Bernal, a pharmaceutical with experience in the hospital pharmacy, pointed out that as our product
            is a GMO for therapeutic purposes, we would have to apply to the EMA (European Medicines Agency) to get the
            commercialization authorization (according to directive 2001/83/CE that establishes a community code on
            medicines for human use and regulation 1234/2008 among others). However, in case our product was launched
            for dietetic purposes (as a dietary supplement) it would need fewer controls and easier to commercialize.</p>
