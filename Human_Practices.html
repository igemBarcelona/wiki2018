        <p class=page-title>HUMAN PRACTICES</h1>
        <p>We believe that bidirectional interaction between society and research is crucial for the development of a
          successful project. In this way, our team has strongly considered expertise advice as well as general public
          opinion, which had directly influenced the direction of our project. </p>

        <p>In this part, we have explored the existing market and alternative therapies, enriching our knowledge with
          advices both from clinical and research areas. We integrated the information given adapting the design of our
          future probiotic and made it suitable for the actual sanitary system. Even though in this project we are only
          presenting a proof of concept, we wanted to give an answer to all the possible issues when developing proper
          probiotic ready to respond currently society needs. </p>
        <h2>Exploring existing therapies</h2>
        </p>When exploring possible existing treatments targeting the same mechanisms we first discussed our project
        with Salvador Aznar-Benitah as he has explored the implications of palmitic acid in metastasis development.
        Recently, his team found that overexpression of CD36 allows cells to take up lipids from their environment,
        positively correlating with the metastatic potential. In fact, it was already well described that high
        expression of CD36 related with poor prognostic in bladder, lung, breast among other cancers, mostly of
        epithelial origin [1]. In this way, he is currently working with CD36 antibodies in an attempt to use them for
        therapeutics. </p>

        </p>Antibodies that block CD36 and therefore its interaction with fatty acids, decrease the ability of cancer
        cells to metastasize. In preclinical studies with mices, Benitah’s team observed that the administration of
        CD36-blocking antibodies reduced the number of metastatic tumors and their sizes by an 80%. Its administration
        had also effects even in cases were metastasis had already been established, with a total removal of the
        metastases in 20% of the animals [2]. </p>

        </p>Even though it is a highly promising strategy, he estimates it would take at least another four years to
        finish the needed clinical trials. Besides, considering the high cost of antibody-based therapies and the
        infrastructures necessary to administer them, our team thought about possible alternatives. In this way, we
        propose a low-cost and accessible approach within everyone’s reach based on synthetic biology. </p>

        <h2>Solving dietetic needs </h2>
        <p>The relationship between long chain fatty acid (LCFA) intake and disease has been well described. It has
          been proved that a diet rich in LCFA can increase the chances of developing a wide range of metabolic
          diseases such as diabetes or obesity [3] but also of cancer development [4]. Interestingly and considering
          the recent evidences already mentioned, it can also be assumed that increasing palmitic acid consumption
          might increase the probabilities of developing metastasis.
        </p>
        <p>Dietary restriction may seem the best approach to this issue. However, as several professionals from the
          Catalan School of nutritionism (<a href="www.codinucat.cat">CoDiNuCat</a>) pointed out, PA-restriction from
          diet is not
          easy. In fact, LCFA are one of the main components of our food intake. In Western diets dietary lipids
          account for 42% of total ingested calories which makes it infeasible to follow a PA-restricted diet [5].
          Information given from Dolors Borau confirmed the lack of an standardized and suitable low LCFA diet for
          cancer patients and brought up the lack of a proper following up when applying this diets.
        </p>
        <p>Considering this, our project sheds light on the need of an alternative approach to this gap in cancer
          patients dietary requirements. Our idea is to target the availability of LCFA directly in the gut with a
          probiotic that could absorb this harmfuls acids in an efficient way.</p>

        <h2>Integrating our product in a clinical framework </h2>
        <p>In order to obtain a product suitable for the existing market and sanitary system we developed a theoretical
          framework in which all the target public needs were included. In this way, information regarding cancer
          patients and cancer therapy was collected and integrated in our probiotic design. </p>

        <p>Our target public will consist of stage 3 and 4 cancer patients, as these two groups are the ones with a
          higher risk to develop metastasis [6]. Stage 3 is understood as the previous phase to metastasis while stage
          4 occurs when a tumor has already spread along the body. However, this does not mean that new metastasis
          process could not occur. </p>

        <p>Cancer patients in the mentioned stages usually receive chemotherapy by cycles, which means there is rest
          periods between chemotherapy treatments. Our probiotic would be ingested by the patient in these rest
          periods. During the resting period, the probability to develop metastasis is higher, as chemotherapy
          treatments kill all cancer cells, including those present in the blood. Thus, in the lack of treatment,
          probability to have cancer cells in the blood grows [7]. Secondly, it’s important to consider that the
          chemotherapy affects to the microbiome, damaging it. This could also affect our probiotic, and could
          therefore produce unbalances in the gut ecosystem.</p>

        <p>Regarding administration, it’s important to consider that cancer patients suffer a lot of ingestion
          problems. Therefore, we consider that the best way to deliver our probiotic could be as a pill or a liquid
          solution. When considering administration it’s also important to be aware of the location of fatty acid
          absorption inside the gut. This absorption occurs mainly in the jejunum but also in the ilium (5%) [8].
          Knowing this, probiotic design will need to consider degradable layers to ensure maximal concentration and
          efficiency of our probiotic in the jejunum. </p>

        <p>We have also contacted with Juan M. Vázquez Lago, to see how our probiotic is in concordance with ethics in
          actual medicine. As Juan explained “considering the different factors that involve the project, our modified
          probiotic would not suppose an ethical problem”.</p>

        <h2>Safety concerns</h2>
        <p>The increasing use of engineered organisms exposes a growing risk of spreading hazardous biological entities
          into the environment. Therefore, key safeguard requirements must be met to prevent the release and
          proliferation of GMOs in natural ecosystems. In this way, extremely robust biocontainment systems must be
          established in engineered organisms, especially those within a therapeutic context [9]. </p>
        <p>After having read and consult with experts in synthetic biology we considered the genomic integration of our
          design using Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) [10]. This would help us to have stable and robust
          expression of our system, consequently preventing horizontal gene transfer and reducing the biosafety
          concerns that could arise from plasmid exchange [11]. </p>

        <p>We also explored additional mechanisms that could be developed to further enhance biosafety. In this way, we
          posed and discussed within a theoretical framework the possibility of developing a biocontainment system
          through different KO. FabA and FabB were proposed as potential targets for developing termosensible strains.
          These genes are responsible for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) essential for maintaining
          cell membrane fluidity [12]. In this way, if the UFAs synthesis is impaired, bacteria are not able to hold
          temperature-dependent changes due to instabilities in the membrane. Consequently, KO of either gene leads to
          UFA auxotrophy [13], which has also been described as a method for biocontainment. </p>

        <h2>Exploring other therapeutic approaches</h2>
        <p>During the development of our product, we discussed other applications and its ethical considerations. LCFA
          are involved in many pathologies, among them some of the most common in developed countries. Thus, when
          trying to develop a system which absorbs LCFA efficiently, some questions about its applicability in other
          diseases arose.</p>

        <h3>Cardiovascular disease:</h3>
        <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the Western world. It contains a broad
          range of pathologies with varied etiologies. LCFA have been described to contribute to the pathogenesis of
          CVD in many different ways: (1) increase of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a strong risk factor
          for CVD (2) atherosclerosis through accumulation of lipids (both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) and
          cholesterol in the subendothelial space (3) increase in insulin resistance due to impaired insulin secretion,
          resulting in hyperinsulinemia and higher glucose levels in blood (4) increase in pro-inflammatory molecules,
          such as endotoxines and cytokines [14]. </p>

        <p>We discussed with Teresa Padró and Judith Cubedo the possibilities of developing our product for
          cardiovascular approaches. They pointed out the controversial on recent studies about the relationship
          between CVD prevention and dietary fats. Indeed, some recent meta-analyses of observational studies have
          shown no association between SFA and CVD risk [15]. However, it must be noted that an important feature still
          to be considered is the foods and/or nutrient replacements which are associated with diets low in SFA.
          Usually, these are coupled with higher intake of poliunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which have been also
          described as harmful for the cardiovascular system [16].
          In this way, we propose an improved alternative, as our probiotic would provide a LCFA-restricted diet
          without the increment of other dietary fats. </p>

        <h3>Diabetes: </h3>
        <p>We also explored its applications in diabetes, as it is one of the most common pathologies in developed
          countries. We spoke with Oriol Iborra and Egea, currently working at the Fundació Institut Investigació
          Germans Trias i Pujol (Cardiology Unit) in Barcelona.</p>

        <p>In the setting of diabetes, a myocardial use of free fatty acids (FFAs) as fuel at the expense of glucose
          occurs due to peripheral insulin resistance and the inability of insulin to suppress lipolysis. As a result,
          an increased energy cost coupled with lipotoxicity and oxidative stress leads to a decrease in cardiac
          efficiency.</p>

        <p>Conversely, ketones are the most energetically efficient fuel for the myocardium. Under conditions of mild,
          persistent hyperketonemia, a shift in fuel metabolism towards a more energy efficient fuel (such as ketone
          bodies) has been hypothesised to be helpful. This shift improves oxygen consumption at the mitochondrial
          level, which could improve myocardial work efficiency, enhance myocardial energetics, reduce oxidative
          stress, improve cardiac systolic function, and ameliorate heart failure.</p>

        <p>In this way and taking into account all the given information, we hypothesized that if our product
          efficiently diminished this FFAs source could potentially bring to a beneficial metabolic switch avoiding
          this decrease in the cardiovascular function. However, as Oriol pointed out “in order to successfully work,
          our product would need to be coupled to an increase in the hiperketonemia, a more efficient energy mean”. </p>

        <h3>Obesity </h3>
        <p>Current scientific evidence indicates that dietary fat plays a role in weight loss. Meta-analyses of
          intervention trials find that fat-reduced diets cause a 3-4 kg larger weight loss than normal-fat diets
          [19]. However, in some cases dietary fat restrictions can be an issue. Thus, our product could be
          approached from a merely dietetic point of view. If it would be the case, our probiotic could be
          administered in situations in which follow up of LCFA-restricted diets had failed and the patient’s
          health was strongly impaired. This point raised a lot of ethical considerations, as illicit use of the
          probiotic for not therapeutic purposes could happen. </p>

        <h3>Chronic intestinal inflammation pathologies:</h3>
        <p>Lipids, beyond their energetic role have also been considered important components of cellular signal
          transduction pathways. Their roles in modulating host inflammatory responses are of clinical interest as
          agents of both promotion and resolution [20]. In this way, dietary long chain fatty acids are also
          implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease
          (IBD) or Crohn’s disease. </p>

        <p>The conversion of dietary lipids to proinflammatory molecules is well defined. Higher intake of long
          chain fatty acids such as PA, has been proposed to increase the amount of eicosanoids in the intestine,
          leading to a growing proportion of potentially inflammatory molecules and thus to an increase the risk of
          developing IBD [21]. Doctors and experts in the field believe that the contribution of SFAs is minor
          compared to one of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which can be metabolized into the
          proinflammatory prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. In this way, our product could serve as
          an efficient potential therapy for this type of pathologies only when coupled to a decrease of PUFAs.
          Thus, further selectivity issues of our system should be explored. </p>
        <h2>Product development:</h2>
        <p>In order to properly develop our product, we need to make it suitable for the current sanitary system
          and ready to be introduced to the market. Thus, we explored the requirements and the needs that our
          probiotic would need to comply to reach that milestone.</p>

        <p>As our product is a GMO organisms, we would have to apply to the EMA (European Medicines Agency) to get
          the commercialization authorization (according to directive 2001/83/CE that establishes a community code
          on medicines for human use and regulation 1234/2008 among others).</p>

        <p>In a ¿long or mid? Term future, we should commercialize our product. We have consult experts in this
          field, and we arrived to consider different strategies for our product.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> If we want to release as a prevention treatment to metastasis we have to do medical trials. As our
            product is a modified probiotic, we would have to apply to the EMA (European Medicines Agency) to get
            the commercialization authorization (according to directive 2001/83/CE that establishes a community
            code on medicines for human use and regulation 1234/2008 among others). We have been advice to contact
            first of all with the EMA to know which studies we should make in order to get an authorisation and
            keep a contact during all the trials process.</li>
          <li>If we want to release it as a dietetic product the controls are fewer and it would be easier to
            commercialize.</li>
          <li> If we want to use our product as a treatment and also as a dietetic product, we have two different
            strategies:
          <li> 1st as dietetic product and after as a treatment:
            This strategy would allow us to release a product to the market meanwhile clinical trials are made,
            which will help us to finance them. </li>
          <li>1st as treatment and after as dietetic:
            By this way, we will delay the release of or product, but it will…..?????</li>
          </li>
        </ul>
