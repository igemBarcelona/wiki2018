            <p class="fig-caption">Team UNebraska-Lincoln. Worst Gel Electrophoresis Scrapbook. <i>"The gel nightmare:
                We had been working hard to obtain a gene construct and after performing several clonings it seemed
                that
                we
                had our desired constructs. We performed a colony PCR and it seemed that we had amplification product,
                YAY.
                So, we happily did the minipreps praying for a good result in the verifying digestion.
                However, when running the gel nothing appeared in it, not even a small band. So that means we had
                nothing
                there and we had to repeat the cloning again.
                This happened at least four times."</i></p>

        <p>Marburg team 2018 invited us to collaborate with them to make our wiki page accessible for people with
          special needs. We are participating with them trying to make our wiki color-blindness friendly. </p>
        <p> We tried to design a accessible user interface. We checked all our color palettes through a color-blindess
          simulator to see if it was accessible or not.</p>

        <p class="subapart1">iGEM MeetUps</p>
        <p class="subapart2">Organised: Spanish MeetUp 2018</p>

        <p>This iGEM season has been great, specially in our country, being the year with more teams registered in
          iGEM. There are five spanish iGEM teams this year, one of them BG-Navarra, formed by High School Students.
          UPF_CRG_Barcelona arranged an Spanish MeetUp from 18th to 20th August in Barcelona Biomedical Research Park
          (PRBB). If anyone wants to check the program, find itind it <a href="http://assets/T--UPF_CRG_Barcelona--spanishmeetup2018.pdf"
            alt="Program Spanish MeetUp 2018">
            here</a>. </p>
        <p>Four teams assisted to the Spanish Meetup, BioIQS-Barcelona, OLM-Madrid, BG_Navarra and Grenoble-Alpes. We
          held presentations to prepare for the Giant Jamboree, we organized workshops in order to discuss doubts and
          problems that an iGEM team can face in Spain and finally we assisted to lectures from researchers in the
          PRBB. The lectures were given out by Professor Jordi García-Ojalvo (Dynamical Systems Biology Lab), PhD Núria
          Conde (Complex Systems Lab and DIY BioBCN) and Professor Marc Güell (Translational Synthetic Biology Lab).
          Finally, we skyped with the european iGEM ambassador, Thea Chrysostomou. </p>
        <p>We also combined some inter-team building between the scientific events. For example, we played beach
          volleyball, we did a tour around the beautiful city of Barcelona and we hiked up to the Air Bunkers in
          Barcelona to observe the stars and get a fantastic stars-master class by the Instructor of BG-Navarra team.
          For our team, holding the meetUp was a great experience in order to get to know the other teams, enrich our
          knowledge and share concerns and worries about the iGEM competition.</p>

        <p class="subapart2">Attended: Mediterrenean MeetUp and Anoooother European MeetUp</p>
        <p class="subapart3">Anooooother European MeetUp by Madrid-OLM</p>
        <p>From 14th to 16th September we attended the MeetUP held by the Madrid-OLM igem team. There we had the
          opportunity to attend to well-known scientist speeches such as Victor de Lorenzo. We also did some
          sight-seeing around the city and share experiences between the teams. </p>

        <p class="subapart3">Mediterrenean MeetUp organized by Aix-Marseille</p>
        <p>From the 9th to 10th August we went to Marseille to attempt to the Summer Mediterranean MeetUp. It was a
          fantastic experience where we could share our projects with other French teams, prepared ourselves for the
          Giant Jamboree and talk with professors from the Aix-Marseille university. The MeetUp included an elevator
          pitch, a poster presentation and also an after-igem workshop.
        </p>

        <p class="subapart1">Other Collborations</p>
        <p class="subapart2">Collaborating with Madrid-OLM</p>
        <p>As our neighbour team, we have been collaborating often with OLM-Madrid iGEM team. They attempt to our
          MeetUp ant there they held a very interesting workshop. The idea was to share and discuss about the problems
          and inconvenients all the igem teams have suffered in Spain. Therefore, this guide could be useful for future
          iGEM generations in order to know in advanced what they will face and, in this way, find an easier way to
          solve it. </p>

        <p>In order to build this guide, OLM-Madrid team prepared a previous outline that was discussed with the rest
          of the teams. Afterwards, we split every point of the outline in a glass and every team could write their
          contribution using different colored pens. This was a visual way to share experiences and doubts that every
          iGEM team had suffered and a great opportunity to find a way to solve them all together. </p>

        <p>On the other hand, they also helped us providing with some DNA constructs and we attempt to their MeetUp
          sharing experiences and having the opportunity to listen to great scientists, for example Victor De Lorenzo.
        </p>
        <p class="subapart2">InterLab with BioIQS-Barcelona</p>
        <p>This year Barcelona is presenting two teams to iGEM: our team formed by undergraduate students and the
          Bio-IQS team, formed by Master students. Following the iGEM spirit we collaborate together. First of all,
          they helped us giving us the transformed bacteria for the interLab study because we had some issues when
          growing them. They also attended to our spanish MeetUp. Finally, we helped them performing PCRs with the
          saliva of a celiac person in order to have more data for their project. </p>
