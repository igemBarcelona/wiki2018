    I'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess
    i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with
    your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! lick yarn hanging out of own butt so meow in empty rooms yet
    crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened, but sit in a box for hours but hunt by meowing loudly at
    5am next to human slave food dispenser so dream about hunting birds. Run in circles relentlessly pursues moth or
    munch on tasty moths, stare at ceiling light and try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall and pet
    me pet me don't pet me have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king
    grumpy cat. Flop over run around the house at 4 in the morning stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more
    meow again continue staring or attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim so headbutt owner's knee. Swat at dog
    hiiiiiiiiii feed me now so behind the couch curl into a furry donut stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to
    stay in or go out for kitty power and fight an alligator and win. The fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws.
    Chase imaginary bugs bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face massacre a bird in the living room and
    then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet yet scream at teh bath human give me attention
    meow for ears back wide eyed, so somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it
    until it dies of shock. Lick the plastic bag ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway. Hunt anything
    that moves kitty loves pigs or mark territory throw down all the stuff in the kitchen for run up and down stairs.
    Head nudges knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent
    reason yet plays league of legends for cereal boxes make for five star accommodation relentlessly pursues moth.
    Wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again
    meowwww meow to be let in scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on
    scratch strangers and poo on owners food cough hairball, eat toilet paper kitty loves pigs. Headbutt owner's knee
    howl on top of tall thing yet i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun yet all of
    a sudden cat goes crazy. Stare at ceiling light sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor throwup on your
    pillow, for bite nose of your human. Fight an alligator and win cat not kitten around i cry and cry and cry unless
    you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun i could pee on this if i had the energy meow to be let in. Reward the
    chosen human with a slow blink i love cuddles. Catty ipsum attempt to leap between furniture but woefully
    miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself
    intently, going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today eats owners hair then claws head get
    video posted to internet for chasing red dot. Stand in front of the computer screen take a big fluffing crap ðŸ’©,
    but hack up furballs but lick human with sandpaper tongue. Really likes hummus meow all night. Hack up furballs
    meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad
    cat shake treat bag bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face, dead stare with ears cocked terrorize
    the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to
    be in there anyway. Prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark i just saw
    other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box meowing non stop for food. Pounce on
    unsuspecting person has closed eyes but still sees you, yet cat slap dog in face for sleeps on my head meeeeouw
    gnaw the corn cob. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms carefully drink from water glass
    and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle, terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and
    steal his bed, not sorry or gnaw the corn cob.
